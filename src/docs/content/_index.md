# workspacer

### a tiling window manager for Windows

Workspacer is a tiling window manager for Windows 10, that is similar in style and function to xmonad.

Currently, Workspacer supports most default xmonad functionality, like custom layout engines, workspace support, and powerful keybinds.

# Keybinds

Workspacer tries to mimic xmonad's keybindings wherever possible. The default keybindings are:

| keybind         | description     |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| alt-shift-e | toggle enabled/disabled |
| alt-shift-c | close focused window |
| alt-space | next layout engine |
| alt-shift-space | previous layout engine |
| alt-n | reset layout |
| alt-j | focus next window |
| alt-k | focus previous window |
| alt-m | focus master window |
| alt-enter | swap focus and master window |
| alt-shift-j | swap focus and next window |
| alt-shift-k | swap focus and previous window |
| alt-h | shrink master area |
| alt-l | expand master area |
| alt-comma | increment number of master windows |
| alt-period | decrement number of master windows |
| alt-shift-q | quit workspacer |
| alt-q | restart workspacer |
| alt-{1..9} | - switch to workspace {1..9} |
| alt-{wer} | focus monitor {123} |
| alt-shift-{wer} | move focused window to monitor {123} |
| alt-shift-{1..9} | move focused window to workspace {1..9} |

# Configuration

Workspacer is entirely configured in actual C# (which means that you can literally configure it however you want!).

# Is this ready for use yet?

Almost! I have posted [a beta build](https://github.com/rickbutton/Workspacer/releases) zipped up as a release here that you are more than welcome to try out! 
Please let me know when (not if!!) you run into any issues. I have done EXTREMELY limited testing outside of my machines, so no promises.
