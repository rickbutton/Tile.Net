# Tile.Net

Tile.Net is a tiling window manager for Windows 10, that is similar in style and function to [xmonad](https://xmonad.org)
(in fact, the keybindings, match xmonad's defaults almost 100%).

Currently, Tile.Net supports most default xmonad functionality, like custom layout engines, workspace support, and powerful keybinds.

# Configuration

Tile.Net is entirely configured in actual C# (which means that you can literally configure it however you want!). 
When Tile.Net starts, it puts a sample configuration file (the default config) in your user folder called `Tile.Net.config`. 
This file is compiled and loading into the process at application startup automatically.

# Is this ready for use yet?

Almost! I need to air out a few quirks, implement a couple more tiny features, and optimize a couple of things. I also need to add proper logging.
Once it's ready, I will post builds here.
